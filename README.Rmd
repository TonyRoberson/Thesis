### SWTRS

The **Student Wellbeing Teacher Report Scales (SWTRS)** were developed by 
Tony Roberson and Dr. Tyler Renshaw. These brief behavior rating scales are
intended for use in universal mental health screening in schools for 
the purposes of identifying student risk, targeting adaptive skill areas 
for intervention, and progress monitoring.

Early exploratory research using a relatively small K-5 elementary school 
suggests the SWTRS item pool may be best described as measuring three
substantive latent factors related to youth wellbeing at school from the
perspective of the classroom teacher, each with strong internal consistency: 
(a) academic engagement, (b) prosocial behavior, and (c) positive emotional
experiences.

These data also suggest responses to the SWTRS may be superior predictors of
concurrent risk in (a) math and reading achievement, (b) time on-task during
class, and (c) number of school absences compared to scores derived from brief
teacher-reported measures of youth internalizing and externalizing problem
behaviorsâ€”the Student Internalizing Behavior Screener and the Student
Externalizing Behavior Screener.
